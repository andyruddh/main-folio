  abstract= {The thesis introduces a novel neurosymbolic learning framework aimed at enhancing the paradigm of learning-from-demonstrations (LfD) to obtain robot control policies. By integrating neural network-based learning with symbolic reasoning, it addresses the challenges posed by imperfect demonstrations and the concerns regarding safety and interpretability in the learned control policies. This innovative approach utilizes Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for expressing high-level robotic tasks and evaluating the quality of demonstrations. STL allows for the creation of non-Markovian rewards and describe causal dependencies between tasks, such as sequential specifications, making it a powerful tool within this framework. Through the LfD-STL framework, reward functions are inferred from suboptimal demonstrations and STL specifications, subsequently utilized by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to derive control policies. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted across diverse environments highlight how this framework outperforms prior state-of-the-art LfD methods. In real-world scenarios, robotic tasks often involve multiple objectives, some of which may inherently conflict, necessitating careful trade-offs. To address this challenge, the thesis extends the LfD-STL framework by introducing performance graphs, which are directed graphs that leverage the quality of demonstrations to provide intuitive explanations regarding performance and trade-offs. These performance graphs not only enhance interpretability but also offer valuable insights into the learning process of RL agents, as confirmed by a user study. Furthermore, they serve as an optimization objective in apprenticeship learning (AL), potentially guiding RL agents to learn policies that outperform the (imperfect) demonstrators. The theoretical analysis within the AL-STL framework provides guarantees in the robustness and performance of RL agents.}

	abstract={In the paradigm of robot learning-from-demonstrations (LfD), understanding and evaluating the demonstrated behaviors plays a critical role in extracting control policies for robots. Without this knowledge, a robot may infer incorrect reward functions that lead to undesirable or unsafe control policies. Prior work has used temporal logic specifications, manually ranked by human experts based on their importance, to learn reward functions from imperfect/suboptimal demonstrations. To overcome reliance on expert rankings, we propose a novel algorithm that learns from demonstrations, a partial ordering of provided specifications in the form of a performance graph. Through various experiments, including simulation of industrial mobile robots, we show that extracting reward functions with the learned graph results in robot policies similar to those generated with the manually specified orderings. We also show in a user study that the learned orderings match the orderings or rankings by participants for demonstrations in a simulated driving domain. These results show that we can accurately evaluate demonstrations with respect to provided task specifications from a small set of imperfect data with minimal expert input.},

	abstract={Learning control policies that are safe, robust and interpretable are prominent challenges in developing robotic systems. Learning-from-demonstrations with formal logic is an arising paradigm in reinforcement learning to estimate rewards and extract robot control policies that seek to overcome these challenges. In this approach, we assume that mission-level specifications for the robotic system are expressed in a suitable temporal logic such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL). The main idea is to automatically infer rewards from user demonstrations (that could be suboptimal or incomplete) by evaluating and ranking them w.r.t. the given STL specifications. In contrast to existing work that focuses on deterministic environments and discrete state spaces, in this letter, we propose significant extensions that tackle stochastic environments and continuous state spaces.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical system applications such as autonomous vehicles, wearable devices, and avionic systems generate a large volume of time-series data. Designers often look for tools to help classify and categorize the data. Traditional machine learning techniques for time-series data offer several solutions to solve these problems; however, the artifacts trained by these algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand, temporal logic, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in the formal methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work, we propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulas that are able to classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on learning STL formulas from data either assumes a formula-template to be given by the user, or assumes some special fragment of STL that enables exploring the formula structure in a systematic fashion. In our technique, we relax these assumptions, and provide a way to systematically explore the space of all STL formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large, and contains many semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically prune the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on various case studies from the automotive and transportation domains.},
